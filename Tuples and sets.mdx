--Tuples and sets


-- **** TUPLES
-- tuples are a slice of data of a cub where all dimensions. 
-- Put another way, a tuple is a vector of members; think of a tuple as one or more records in the underlying database whose value in these columns falls under these categories. 
-- a set is composed by tuples having same dimensions
-- A tuple can encompass members in multiple dimensions, as well as multiple members from the same dimension. BUT NOT FROM THE SAME HIERARCHY

-- **** SETS
//A set is an ordered collection of zero, one or more tuples. A set is most commonly used to define axis 
//and slicer dimensions in an MDX query, and as such may have only a single tuple or may be, in certain cases, empty. 
//Sets and Dimensionality
//Like tuples, sets also have dimensionality. As a set is composed of tuples, so the dimensionality of 
//a set is expressed by the dimensionality of each tuple within it. Because of this, tuples within a set must have the same dimensionality.
// In other words, this example would not work as a set:
//{ (Time.[2nd half], Route.nonground.air), (Route.nonground.air, Time.[2nd half]) }
//The order of tuples in a set is important; it affects, for example, the nesting order in an axis dimension. 
//The first tuple represents the first, or outermost, dimension, the second tuple represents the next outermost dimension, and so on.
